## Create products

To create a product you must first decide which product type it belongs to.

Product types represent categories that a product can belong to.
A product type can be, for example, a sofa or a keyboard.

Product types, like Content Types, define the global properties of products and Fields a product consists of.
A product type also defines the attributes that all products of this type can have.

## Attributes

Attributes describe a product's characteristics.
The customer can use them to filter and search for products.

Typical product attribute examples are: length, weight, color, format, and so on.

Each attribute belongs to an attribute group.
An example of an attribute group can be dimensions (which consists of length, width, height, and so on).

When adding attributes to product types, you can add both individual attributes, and whole groups.
