# Product page URLs

Every [Product item](products.md) has a system URL that is automatically generated. It is based on a pattern that combines fields and attributes to build the URL (URL alias name pattern).

When you are creating new [Product Type](create_product_types.md) you can set up Product URL alias name pattern.

To do it, fill in all necessary information and choose the attributes that you want to use in URL alias name pattern field and click **Save** button.

Now, you can see new URL alias name pattern in the Product Type's view.

## Product Attributes identifiers

Products have their own [attributes](products.md#attributes) that provide different information about them. 

The following attribute types can be used in URL alias name pattern field:

- Checkbox
- Color
- Integer
- Selection
- Measurement (single)
- Measurement (range)

!!! note

    Float atribute is not available while creating URL alias name pattern.

| Type | Returned value | Example|
|---|---|---|
| Checkbox | Label of the checkbox is checked | wireless |
| Color | Hex code value | 8b0000 |
| Integer | Integer | 26 |
| Measurement (single) | Single value and unit | 256gb |
| Measurement (range) | Value unit and minimum/maximum values | 20-25cm|
| Selection | Selected value with configured separator | children-infants |

You can use many attributes identifiers as well as fields identifiers in the URL alias pattern field. 

Having keyword-rich URLs also improves the product's visibility in search engine results and boost the page's ranking in search results.

## Create custom URL

You can create custom URL for each Product.
Customized URLs are easy to remember, help for SEO optimatization and reduce bounce rates on the website.
It improves the user experience - you can understand what the product is about just by reading the link. 

To do it, follow the steps:

1\. In the left panel, go to **Product catalog** -> **Products**.

2\. Choose the Product from the list.

3\. Click on **URL** tab in the product's view. Here you can see both custom URL aliases and system URL.

You can manage all the product URLs, both system and custom ones: create new and edit or delete existing ones.
