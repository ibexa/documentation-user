# Preview content items

There are several places where you can see how the content item could look to an end-user.
The system behaves differently depending on whether you're in [Focus Mode](../getting_started/discover_ui.md#focus-mode) or not and whether you selected a specific site from the **Site context** drop-down list in the top bar.

- When you [edit a Page](create_edit_content_items.md), the editor provides a visual experience.
By clicking the following icons, you can switch between different Page views.

|Icon|Description|
|------|-----------|
|![Preview segments](page_builder_toolbar_preview_segment.png)|Access preview of the Page for a given [segment](content_organization/classify_content.md#segments).|
|![Timeline button](page_builder_toolbartimelinetoggler.png)|Access the timeline to preview how the Page changes with time. You can also view the list of all upcoming scheduled events.|

- When you [edit a content item](create_edit_content_items.md), click **Preview**
- In the content item's details screen, click **Preview**

!!! tip

    In the content item preview screen, you can use a drop-down list to change site context by switching between [SiteAccesses](translate_content.md#siteaccess).
    You can also toggle through different screen widths to see how the content item is rendered on different devices.

Additionally, if you select a specific SiteAccess from the **Site context** drop-down list in the top bar, three things happen:

- when you hover over content items in the content tree, miniature previews appear
- in Focus mode, when you browse content items in content tree, their full screen preview is displayed
- if you [disable the Focus mode](../getting_started/discover_ui.md#disable-focus-mode) or click **Exit full view**, the **View** tab appears in the content item's details view, where you can quickly preview the content item
