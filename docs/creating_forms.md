## Viewing results

Once you publish a form and users start filling it in, you can preview the results in the **Submissions** tab in the Content item view.

Here you can view the details of each submission.
You can also delete any submissions (for example if they were made while testing or contain spam).

The **Download submissions** button enables you to download all the submissions in a .CSV (comma-separated value) file.
