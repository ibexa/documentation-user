# Create products

[Products](products.md#products) are a specific kind of [Content items](../content_management/content_items.md#content-items) that you use 
to present your offer in the website, including product specification, and pricing.

Individual products are instances of [product types](create_product_types.md#create-product-types).

You can only create or modify products when your [user role](../permission_management/work_with_permissions.md) has the `Product/Edit` permission.

To create a product, depending on the configuration, you [may need to provide](products.md#product-completeness) certain pieces of information, 
such as a name, SKU, description and images, attributes, assets, availability, prices, and translations.

## Manually create product

You can create product in several ways:

1. Click **Create** in the upper-right corner of the [Products](products.md) screen. 
2. While viewing a **Product Catalog** in the [Content Tree](../getting_started/discover_ui.md#content-tree), click **Create content** at the top of the screen.
The new item appears in the tree.
3. Click **Create content** in the upper-right corner of the [My dashboard](../getting_started/discover_ui.md) screen. In this case you have to choose content type and select where the content will be located.

1\. Use one of the methods mentioned above to start editing a product.

2\. From their lists, select the language and the product type, and then click the **Add** button.

3\. Fill in content fields of the product, for example, name, specification and description.
The [Fields](../content_management/content_model.md#fields-and-field-types) that you have to populate depend on how the Product Type is defined. 
Fields marked with an asterisk (*) are required.

4\. Click **Create** button.

You can edit existing products at any time:

2\. Click the **Edit** button next to a name of the product item that you want to modify.

3\. Edit product details and attributes, and click the **Update** button.

## Work with products

- [Add specific attributes](create_product_types.md#work-with-product-attributes)
- [Set availability, stock and price](manage_prices_and_stock.md#work-with-availability-stock-and-prices)
- [Assign it to specific category](work_with_product_categories.md)
- [Create variants](work_with_product_variants.md)
