## Campaign

A campaign is a set of different concepts, grouped per steps, and open to configuration.

It can contain a welcome screen, a form step, an interaction element, an exit screen, and so on.

You can use Qualifio's existing templates and interactive elements, such as quizzes, pools, and forms, to create visually appealing, customized campaigns.
Users can configure the backgrounds, themes, and designs.

Use campaign to interact with viewers, boost ad impressions, or gather cookies from targeted audiences.

Each campaign comes with a unique ID - string of numbers, that the platform automatically defines at the creation. Campaign ID is a reference to the campaign in the applications, services and data connections.
You can set up a specific time frame for each campaign, use conditions, and design.

You can also set up prizes for customer when an email or another required pool is filled.
A prize can be, like special discount, bonus, or free access to some content.

## Publication channel

Every campaign includes a minimum of one publication channel that you can choose from the three options the platform provides for publishing a campaign:

- **Widget/iframe** - uses a JavaScript code or an HTML iframe from Qualifio. Additionally, you can use oEmbed, Facebook Instant articles, and AMP technologies to publish iframes. You need to manually paste the code into your website or CMS.

- **Minisite** - uses a unique URL from Qualifio that can hosts the campaign. This URL points to your subdomain.

- **Mobile** - uses a link from Qualifio to integrate a campaign that is optimized for mobile usage.

!!! note
    Each publication channel type is automatically responsive and can be used on any mobile device.
