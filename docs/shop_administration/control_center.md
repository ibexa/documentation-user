# Control center

Some sections of the Control center are available only when you have a connection to an ERP system.

## ERP request log

All communication (request and response messages) that is sent between shop and ERP system is recorded and displayed here.

## ERP performance

If an ERP system is connected, the ERP performance viewer shows the efficiency of the connection between the shop and the ERP system.
It displays the number of the different requests per date and time.

The monitoring tool regularly checks the connection to the ERP with a test request.

If the connection fails, the administrator receives an email.
If the connection is successful again, the alarm is ended by another email.

## email archive

In the **email archive** tab the shop owner/admin can find all emails which were automatically sent from the shop,
with date of sending, recipient, subject and status. They can see the emails and resend them.
