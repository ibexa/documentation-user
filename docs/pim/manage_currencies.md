# Work with currencies

Currencies are taken into account when calculating product price.

You can configure currencies available in the system.
To do it, in the left panel, go to **Product catalog** -> **Currencies**.

![Manage currencies](img/manage_currencies.png "Manage currencies")

The system contains a list of different currencies.
To use them in the catalog, edit and enable them.

![Enabling a currency](img/enable_currency.png "Enabling a currency")

To create an additional currency, provide its code (for example, EUR, USD, or GBP) and the number of fractional digits, that is, the number of digits after the comma/period.

For example, the configuration for the Swiss franc would be `CHF` with two fractional digits.
