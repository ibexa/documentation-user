# AI Actions

AI Actions is a set of capabilities that enhance the efficiency and creativity of content editors.
The feature is not included in [[= product_name =]] by default.
It's an [LTS Update]([[= developer_doc =]]/release_notes/ibexa_dxp_v4.6/#lts-updates) that requires separate [installation and configuration]([[= developer_doc =]]/ai_actions/install_ai_actions/) by the system administrator.

Once AI Actions are installed and configured, content editors with `Action configuration/View` and `Action configuration/Execute` permissions have access to AI-driven tools.
For example, they can [enhance or improve the text](create_edit_content_items.md#ai-assistant) that they have written, or [generate alternative text](upload_images.md#ai) for images.

If you have administrator permissions, you can decide what capabilities are available to the editors by [configuring AI actions](work_with_ai_actions.md).
You can also modify the parameters of individual AI actions, to control the creativity of the AI or the cost involved with using it.
