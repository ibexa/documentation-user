# Work with payments

In Ibexa DXP, you can view a list of payments and modify their statuses on the **Payments** screen.
By default, depending on your permissions, you can access your own payments or all the payments that exist in the system.

## Viewing payment status

1\. In the left panel, go to **Commerce** -> **Payments**.

// use search to find payments and filters narrow down the search results list
...

Note: Payment statuses are defined in Payment workflow (link to dev doc).

## Changing payment details

If your [user role](../permission_management/work_with_permissions.md) has the `Payment/Edit` permission, you can change the status of an existing payment.
