# Product page URLs

Every [Product](products.md) has its own URLs that is automatically generated. It is based on a pattern that says which field or fields are used to build the URL (URL alias name pattern).
Product can have multiple URLs if it is included in many catalogs and exposed to many sites.

## Product Attributes identifiers

Products have their own [attributes](products.md#attributes) that provide different information about them. 

The following attribute types are available:

- Checkbox
- Color
- Integer
- Measurement
- Selection

You can use attributes identifiers in the URL alias pattern field. 
A customized URL is short and easy to remember. 

It can help to understand what the product is about just by reading the link. 
It improves the user experience and reduces bounce rates on the website.

Having keyword-rich URLs also improves the product's visibility in search engine results and boost the page's ranking in search results..

| Type | Returned value | Example|
|---|---|---|
| Checkbox | Label of the checkbox is checked | wireless |
| Color | Hex code value | 8b0000 |
| Integer | Integer | 26 |
| Measurement | Value and unit | 256gb |
| Selection | Selected value with configured separator | children-infants |
