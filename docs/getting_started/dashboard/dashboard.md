# Dashboard

Dashboard is the first screen that you see after you log into [[= product_name =]].
It provides users a quick overview about specific content to make better business decisions based on data and work more efficiently with a clear and easy access to important information.

Dashboard in [[= product_name_headless =]] contains the following blocks:

- [Review queue](dashboard_block_reference.md#review-queue-block)
- [My content](dashboard_block_reference.md#my-content-block)
- [Common content](dashboard_block_reference.md#common-content-block)

You can return to the **Dashboard** screen from any other page by clicking the [[= product_name_base =]] logo on the left of the top bar, or the home icon in the main menu.

You can customize the dashboard depending on your needs.
A customized dashboard contains a set of widgets selected by the user.

Customization allows you to quickly visit the areas that are used more often and exclude those less important:

- Selected widgets boost productivity by highlighting vital data and helping in decision making
- Predefined and custom layouts improve visibility for efficient task and deadline management

By default, dashboard in [[= product_name_exp =]] and [[= product_name_com =]] contains the following blocks:

- [Quick actions](dashboard_block_reference.md#quick-actions-block)
- [Recent activity](dashboard_block_reference.md#recent-activity-block)
- [Ibexa News](dashboard_block_reference.md#ibexa-news-block)
- [Review queue](dashboard_block_reference.md#review-queue-block)
- [My content](dashboard_block_reference.md#my-content-block)
- [Common content](dashboard_block_reference.md#common-content-block)
