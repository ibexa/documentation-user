# Dashboard

Dashboard is the first screen that you see after you log into [[= product_name =]].
By default, it contains the following blocks:

- Quick actions
- Recent activity
- Ibexa news
- Review queue
- My content
- Common content

For a detailed description of all available blocks, see [Dashboard block reference](dashboard_block_reference.md).

You can return to the **Dashboard** screen from any other page by clicking the '[[= product_name_base =]]' logo on the left of the top bar, or the home icon in the main menu.

## Customizable dashboard

You can customize the dashboard depending on your needs.
A customized dashboard contains a set of widgets selected by the user.

Customization allows you to quickly visit the areas that are used more often and exclude those less important:

- Selected widgets boost productivity by highlighting vital data and helping in decision making
- Predefined and custom layouts improve visibility for efficient task and deadline management
