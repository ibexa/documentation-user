# Content items

A content item is a single piece of content: an article, a blog post, an image, or a product.
Each content item has general characteristics, such as name and identifier.
It also contains [fields](content_model.md#fields-and-field-types).
These fields can differ depending on what kind of content you're dealing with.
An *article* content item may consist of fields, for example, *title*, *name*, *author*, *body*, *image*, or *subscriber teaser*.
A *product* content item may have, for example, *product name*, *category*, *price*, *size*, or *color*, as fields.

In [[= product_name =]], you create content items based on templated called [content types](content_model.md#content-types).

## Access content in the UI

In the back office, you can view the content in your repository in several places, for example:

- [Content structure](../getting_started/discover_ui.md#content-tree)
- [Content browser](../getting_started/discover_ui.md#content-browser)
- [User list](../user_management/manage_users.md)
- [Products list](../persona_paths/manage_products.md)
