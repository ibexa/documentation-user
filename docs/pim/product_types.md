# Product types

Product types are templates that contain a combination of [Fields](../content_management/content_model.md#fields-and-field-types) and [attributes](#attributes) which constitute a product definition.
By default, product types contain such Fields as name, specification, image, or category.
You can modify them as required.
You need different product types, because products of type "Laptops" contain different Fields and attributes than those of type "White appliances".

A product type also defines both the attributes and VAT rates for all its products.

If your [user Role](../permission_management/work_with_permissions.md) has the `ProductType/Edit` 
permission, you can [modify product types and add individual attributes or attribute groups](create_product_types.md).

### Attributes

Attributes describe product characteristics.
Customers can use them to filter and search for products.
Attribute types define what kind of information you can store in an attribute.
Typical product attribute examples include dimensions, weight, color, or format.

For more information, see [Work with product attributes](work_with_product_attributes.md).
