## Customizable dashboard

You can customize the dashboard depending on your needs.
Customized dashboard previews a set of widgets selected by the user.

Customization allows you to quickly visit the areas that are used more often and exclude those less important:

- Selected widgets boost productivity by highlighting vital data and helping in decision making
- Predefined and custom layouts improve visibility for efficient task and deadline management
