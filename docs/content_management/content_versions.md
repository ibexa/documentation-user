# Content versions

In [[= product_name =]], Content items can have more than one version.
Each version can be either published, archived, or a draft.

The **published version** is the version that is currently used on the website.
Every Content item can have only one published version at a time.

Whenever you edit and publish a Content item again, its previous published version becomes an **archived version**.
It is not available to the visitor and you cannot edit it, but you can create new drafts based on any archived version.

Finally, **drafts** are version that have not been published yet.

You can view all versions of a Content item in the **Versions** tab.

### Autosave

While you edit a Content item or product, [[= product_name =]] saves your work automatically to help you preserve the progress in an event of a failure.
To recover your work, open the most recent draft in the **Versions** tab of the Content item.
Alternatively, open the most recent draft of your work on the **My dashboard** page, the **Drafts** table.

Autosave is enabled by default, and set to save a draft every 60 seconds.
You can toggle autosave or change the time between saving attempts in **User settings**, by changing
the values in the **Autosave draft** and **Autosave interval** fields.

### Compare versions

You can compare two versions of the same Content item by clicking the compare icon
in the **Versions** tab:

Select the two version you want to compare in the drop-down menus at the top of the screen.

You can choose to view the comparison in two columns, side by side,
or in one column, with differences highlighted.
