# Create and edit payment methods

If your [user role](work_with_permissions.md) has the `Payment method/Create` permission, you can create payment methods. 
With the `Payment method/Edit` permission, you can modify existing ones.

!!! note "Payment method limitations"

    By default, you can only create payment methods of type "Offline".
    
    Payment methods created in legacy Commerce cannot be migrated when you upgrade. You have to define them from scratch.

1. In the left panel, go to **Commerce** -> **Payment methods**, and click **Create**.
2. Select the language for the new payment method and its type.
3. In the next screen provide information about the new payment method.
