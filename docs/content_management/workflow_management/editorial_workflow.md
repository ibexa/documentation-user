# Editorial workflow

With editorial workflow, you can pass content between different stages in a preconfigured flow.
Typically, the stages correspond to different teams or departments that contribute to content and approve it.

For example, you can pass content through stages of draft, design, and proofreading.

!!! note

    Workflows are configured differently in each installation.
    In your workflows you can have different stages and transition between them.

    Contact your administrator or developer team to configure workflows.
    For more information, see [Developer Documentation]([[= developer_doc =]]/content_management/workflow/workflow/).

## Review queue

You can view content items which are in different stages under review on **My dashboard** screen, in the **Review queue** table.
The table only shows content items that your role has permissions to edit.
If your installation is [configured to support draft locking]([[= developer_doc =]]/content_management/workflow/workflow/#draft-locking), the table also informs you whether any reviewers are assigned and have claimed their drafts for review.

In the Review queue table, you can access the draft for editing, review its history, unlock the draft, or request that a lock is released.

For more information, see [Work with versions](work_with_versions.md).
