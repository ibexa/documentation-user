# Company self-registration

Self-Registration for Company accounts.
A prospective buyer can register their company on a seller's website by submitting a form.
This action creates an application in the back office, and it will go through a series of approval processes.

OTB will have a simple workflow to approve, reject or put the application on hold.
But this workflow can be extended to incorporate the business processes of the seller. 
Once approved, a company account and it's structure is created.



Default workflow:

Accept/reject

If accepted:

- assign sales rep
- set customer group
- create account, 
- send invite to Admin

Once admin registers, set it as contact.

If rejected, option to leave a note after rejection. The note is stored for future reference
