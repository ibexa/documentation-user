# PIM (Product Information Management)

With PIM you can create, configure and manage products that are offered in the [[= product_name =]]-based website and/or storefront, including their specifications, attributes, assets, variants and pricing.

You can group products into categories and catalogs.
Catalogs are collections of products selected by using configurable filters.
Categories let you organize products within PIM and create relationships between them, for example, to help customers in searching for products.

PIM's features are available from the left-hand menu.
