# Work with permissions

You can view and modify all [permissions](permission_system.md) by clicking **Roles** in the **Admin Panel**.

1\. Click **Create** and provide a name to get an empty, unassigned Role.

2\. Click **Save and close** to see a list of Policies that the Role has.

3\. Click **Add**, select a Policy from the list and click **Save and close**.

You then may have an option to add Limitations to the Policy.
The available Limitations depend on the chosen Policy.
You can then return to a list of Policies by clicking **Save and close** or **Discard**.
