# Create and edit content items

## Create content items

1. Start creating a new content item in one of the following ways:

    - In the left panel, go to **Content** -> **Content structure**. Then select a parent content item and click **Create content**.

        The new content item becomes a child of the content item that you originally selected.

    - In the **Quick actions** block of the [Dashboard](../getting_started/discover_ui.md#dashboard) screen, click **Create content**.
    Then choose a location for the new item in [content browser](../getting_started/discover_ui.md#content-browser) and click **Create**.

    !!! tip

        An alternative way of creating content items is to [drag one or more files](#upload-multiple-content-items) onto the **Sub-items** tab when viewing any content item in a [content tree](../getting_started/discover_ui.md#content-tree).

1. In a slide-out pane, make initial choices in the following fields, and click **Create**:

    - **Select a language** - from a drop-down list, select the base language for the content item.
    - **Select a content type** - use this field to narrow down the list of choices displayed below. Then select a content type to serve as a template for the content item.

    !!! note

        If you're using [[= product_name_exp =]] or [[= product_name_com =]], the options include forms and pages.
        You then [build forms](work_with_forms.md) and [create pages](create_edit_pages.md) by using their respective specialist tools.

1. [Fill in the fields](#edit-new-or-existing-content-items) of the content item.

1. Click **Preview** to see how the content item could look to an end-user.

    !!! tip

        A content item can look different on different [SiteAccesses](translate_content.md#siteaccess).
        You can select a SiteAccess to preview by using a drop-down in the preview screen.

1. To discard your changes and close the window, click **Delete draft**.

1. To save your changes:

    - Click **Save** to continue editing.
    - Click **Save and close** to close the window.

1. To send your changes to another editor [for review](editorial_workflow.md), click **Send to review**.

1. When the content item is ready for publication:

    - Click **Publish** to publish it immediately.
    - Click **Publish later** to set a specific publication date.

    For more information, see [Publish content](publish_content.md).

!!! note "Versioning and autosave"

    Whenever you edit a content item, a [new version](content_versions.md) is created in the repository.

    To help you preserve your work, [[= product_name =]] saves drafts of content items automatically.
    For more information, see [Autosave](content_versions.md#autosave).

##### Upload multiple content items

When you view the content item details in the content tree, you can upload files such as images, videos, or PDF documents.
This way you can add multiple sub-items without editing the original content item.
To do it, on the content item details screen, in the **Sub-items** tab, click **Upload** and choose all items that you want to upload.
When a file is uploaded with multi-file upload, it's automatically stored in a field of the content item.

!!! note

    The content type for the uploaded files is selected automatically by the system.

![Multi-file upload](img/multi_file_upload.png)

## Edit new or existing content items

Each content item is based on a [content type](create_edit_content_types.md). The content type defines what fields
you have to fill in when creating a new item.
It may also determine the layout or style in which this item is displayed.

Fields marked with an asterisk (\*) are required.
You can't save the content item without filling them in.

Some fields, such as *Relation* field (which links two content items) or *Image* field,
require you to select a different content item to link to.
A *Location* field is a point on the map. You can type the place name, enter its coordinates, or select it on the map.

<a name="relation_field"></a>

!!! note

    When you create or edit a content item that contains an *Image* or an *Image asset* field,
    you can perform basic image editing functions by using an [Image Editor](../image_management/edit_images.md).

### Edit Rich Text fields

Rich Text fields are filled in using a special Online Editor. Its options appear when you click the field box.

#### Distraction free mode

Distraction free mode expands the workspace to full screen and shows only editor toolbar.

to quickly jump through sections of an article.
Create an anchor by clicking in the area to link to and selecting the anchor icon from the editor menu.
In the modal window, provide the name for the anchor. Scroll to the fragment where you want to insert the link,
and select the text to appear as a link. In the modal window, click the **Link** button.
