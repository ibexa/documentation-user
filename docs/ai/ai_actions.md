# AI Actions

AI Actions is a powerful set of capabilities designed to enhance the efficiency and creativity of content editors.
With AI Actions, editors can streamline their workflow, making content creation faster while enabling new levels of creativity. 
AI Actions are not included by default in [[= product_name =]].
It's an add-on to the product and requires separate installation and configuration by the system administrator.
For more information about installing and configuring AI Actions, see [developer documentation]([[= developer_doc =]]/generative_ai/ai_actions/).

Once AI Actions are installed and configured, content editors gain access to a variety of AI-driven tools.
Depending on the options selected during configuration, the AI Assistant can assist editors in multiple ways.
For example, editors can use the AI to [enhance or improve the text](create_edit_content_items.md#ai-assistant) that they have written.
AI can also [generate alternative text](upload_images.md#ai) for images.
This alternative text is later used by screen readers and other assistive technologies to provide descriptions of images to users who cannot see.

If you have sufficient permissions, you can control which specific AI Actions capabilities are made available to content editors.
If you have sufficient permissions, you can decide what capabilities are available to the editors by [configuring AI actions](work_with_ai_actions.md).
You do it by configuring the settings of individual AI actions, where you can enable or disable certain features based on the needs of your editorial team.
