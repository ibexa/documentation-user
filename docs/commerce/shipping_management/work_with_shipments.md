# Work with shipments

In Ibexa DXP, you can view a list of shipments and modify their statuses on the **Shipments** screen.
By default, depending on your permissions, you can access your own shipments or all the shipments that exist in the system.

## Viewing shipment status

1\. In the left panel, go to **Commerce** -> **Shipments**.

// use search to find shipments and filters narrow down the search results list
...

Note: Payment statuses visible in the xxx filter field are defined in Payment workflow (link to dev doc).

## Changing shipment details

If your [user role](../permission_management/work_with_permissions.md) has the `Shipment/Update` permission, you can modify the details of an existing shipment.
