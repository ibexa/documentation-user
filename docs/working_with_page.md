# Working with Page

!!! enterprise
    
    **Page** is a special Content Type that contains zones onto which you can drop different dynamic blocks.
    You can edit it to personalize the layout and contents of your website.
    
    
    !!! tip
        The Page Content Type contains a **Landing Page** Field Type which manages the zones and blocks.
        Any Content item that has the **Landing Page** Field Type will behave like the Page Content Type.
        
    ## Creating Page
    
    To create a new Page, in the upper toolbar click **Content** and from the list below select **Content Structure**.
    On the right-side toolbar click **Create** and from the list of Content items select **Landing page**.
    In the **Page creation** select the layout and click **Create**.
    
    You can also add a new Page in the Page Builder.
    Open the Page Builder by clicking **Page** and selecting the page from the list appearing below.
    On the [Page Builder toolbar](#page-builder-toolbar) click the plus button and from the list select **Landing page**.
    Select the layout and click **Create**.
    
    Before publishing or saving the Page, edit its title and description.
    Switch to the Field view using the [Page Builder toolbar](#page-builder-toolbar).
        
    ## Editing Page
    
    You edit Pages using the Page Builder.
    To start editing an existing Page, in the Back Office click **Page** and select the page from the list that appears below.

    ## Page Builder toolbar
    
    The Page Builder comes with a toolbar that enables you to perform advanced editing and previewing of the Page.
    
    ![Page Builder Toolbar](img/page_builder_toolbar.png)
    
    Using the toolbar buttons, you can perform the following actions:
    
    |Button|Description|
    |------|-----------|
    |![Edit and preview switch](img/page_builder_toolbar_editpreview.png)|Switch between previewing and editing the Page.|
    |![Page view and Field view switch](img/page_builder_toolbar_viewedit.png)|Switch between the Page view and the Field view.|
    |![View toggler](img/page_builder_toolbar_devicestoggler.png)|Toggle through to see how the Page is rendered on different devices.|
    |![Timeline button](img/page_builder_toolbartimelinetoggler.png)|Access the timeline to preview how the Page changes with time. You can also view the list of all upcoming scheduled events. For details, see [Timeline](publishing/advanced_publishing_options.md#timeline).|
    |![Page builder menu button](img/page_builder_toolbarpopmenu.png)|Access menu enabling you to switch layout, see versions of the Page, manage translations, or delete the Page.|
    |![Create new button](img/page_builder_toolbarcreatebutton.png)|Create a new Content item.|
    
    In a newly created Page you must first choose a layout which defines the available zones.
    You can switch it later by using the following menu:
    
    ![Switching Page layouts](img/switch_layout.png)
    
    Applying a layout divides the Page into the defined zones. The zones are placeholders for Content items.
    Now you are ready to add blocks of content to the Page.
    
    ## Adding blocks
    
    In Page Builder you can access a menu of **Elements** — a set of blocks of content that you can add to the zones of the Page.
    Each block is unique in its function and enables you to customize the content appearing on the Page.
    
    ![Dragging a block onto a zone](img/dragging_lp_block.png "Dragging a block onto a zone")
    
    Add a block by dragging it from the menu to an empty place on a zone.
    Do not worry about placing blocks in the proper place from the start.
    You can reorder them at any time by dragging and dropping them in the desired location.
    
    eZ Enterprise comes with a set of ready-to-use Page blocks,
    but [developers can add their own](https://doc.ibexa.co/en/2.5/guide/extending_page/#creating-page-blocks).
    
    ![Elements menu](img/elements_menu.png "Elements menu")
    
    The blocks provided with a clean installation of eZ Enterprise are:
    
    |Block|Description|

    |Form|Embeds a Form Content item that you select from the Content Structure. For details, see [Form block](#form-block).|

    ## Block settings
    
    ### Blocks of content
    
    Each kind of block has its special properties. 
    You can access them by placing the cursor on the added block and clicking the cog button.
    Use the same menu to remove the block from the Page by clicking the trash button.
    
    ![Elements settings](img/page_builder_elementsettings.png)
    
    Settings available for blocks are divided into three tabs — **Basic**, **Design**, and **Scheduler**.
    The settings available in the **Basic** tab are tailored to the block's content.
    
    
    The remaining tabs contain parameters common to all blocks provided with eZ Enterprise. 
    Use them to modify the layout and visibility of a block. For details, see [Advanced publishing options](publishing/advanced_publishing_options.md).
    
    
    You can't publish a Page if you have not set all the required settings of all blocks.

        For details on adjusting and using them, contact your website administrator.
