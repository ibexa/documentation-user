# Configure personalization

In the Back Office, you can you can review the configuration that controls 
the Personalization service.
If your [user role](../permission_management/permissions_and_users.md) has 
the `Personalization/Edit` permission that includes your website, you can modify 
the settings according to your requirements.
To do this, navigate to one of the pages mentioned below and edit the item that you want to modify.

!!! note "Host multiple websites"

    If you have permissions to access several websites hosted on an [[= product_name =]] 
    instance, you can use the selector field to switch between views for each 
    of these websites.

## Models

The **Models** page lists all available models and provides detailed information, 
such as the scenarios or segments that use each model or when the model was last triggered.
Models come predefined with the service, based on the arrangements that your 
organization makes with Ibexa when defining the initial configuration.
You can request that a specific model is created by contacting customer support.
