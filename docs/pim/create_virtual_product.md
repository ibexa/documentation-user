# Virtual products

Virtual product is a special type of a [Product](products.md). 

Virtual products are non-tangible items such as memberships, services, warranties. 
They can be sold individually, or as part of a product bundle.

Like physical products, virtual products can have their own [variants](work_with_product_variants.md), [assets](work_with_product_assets.md) or [attributes](products.md#attributes). 
You can also create catalogs from them, check their completeness and set [prices, availability, and stock](manage_availability_and_stock.md).

## Create virtual product type

If your [user Role](work_with_permissions.md) has the `ProductType/Edit` permission, you can modify product types and add individual attributes or attribute groups.

To create a virtual product, first, you have to create a virtual product type.

1\. In the left panel, go to **Product catalog** -> **Product Types** and click **Create**.

2\. From the drop-down list choose "Virtual" type and click **Add**.

4\. Add Fields that describe the product by dragging them from the **Field types** 
area to a section on the left, and then [configure them](configure_ct_field_settings.md).

5\. Add attributes by dragging them from the toolbox on the right.

6\. Click **Save**.
