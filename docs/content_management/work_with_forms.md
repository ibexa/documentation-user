# Work with forms

You can use forms to increase the functionality of the website by adding a survey, questionnaire, sign-up form, etc.
You can then review the results gathered from website users, for example, to improve user experience.

For more information about building and styling forms, see [developer documentation]([[= developer_doc =]]/content_management/forms/forms).

## Create forms

Editors can use the created form anywhere on the website.
Forms can be used in page blocks, embedded in the online editor or even used as a field relation.
The same form can be placed at multiple locations on the website.

To create a form:

1\. In the left panel, go to **Content** -> **Form** and click **Create content**.

2\. In a slide-out pane, make initial choices in the following fields, and click **Create**:

- **Select a language** - from a drop-down list, select the base language for the content item.
- **Select a content type** - use this field to narrow down the list of content type choices displayed below. Then select **Form**, and click the **Create** button.

## View results

Once you publish a form and users start filling it in, you can preview the results in the **Submissions** tab in the content item view.

Here you can view the details of each submission.
You can also delete any submissions (for example if they were made while testing or contain spam).
