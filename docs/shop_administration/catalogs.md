# Catalogs

You can create catalogs which contain a selection of products from the system.

Use catalogs, for example, to build special discount catalogs, campaigns, or tenders.

## Creating catalogs

To create a catalog:

1. In the **Product catalog** section in the menu, select **Catalogs**.
2. Click **Create**.
3. Enter the name and identifier for the catalog.
4. Select filters that decide which products are included in the catalog.
5. Click **Create**.

### Catalog filters

You can use the following filters to select products for a catalog:

- product category
- product attributes

You can also select additional filters from the **Add filter** menu:

![]()

- product type
- product code
- product availability
- product price, in selected currency, with the option to set minimum and maximum price
- the date when the product was created

The **Products** section at the bottom of the catalog screen shows a preview of which products fit the current filters.
You can also remove selected filters there.

You can view all products in a catalog in its **Products** tab:

## Copying catalogs

You can copy existing catalogs, for example to create a variant version of an offer with slightly differing filters.
To do so, in the catalog's view screen click **Copy**.

You can then modify the copied catalog (for example, change its name or fine-tine filters), and save the updated version.
