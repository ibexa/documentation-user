# AI Actions

AI Actions is a set of capabilities that enhance the efficiency and creativity of content editors.
The feature is not included in [[= product_name =]] by default.
It's an [LTS Update]([[= developer_doc =]]/ibexa_products/editions#lts-updates) that requires separate [installation and system configuration]([[= developer_doc =]]/ai_actions/install_ai_actions/).

Once AI Actions are installed and configured, content editors with `Action configuration/View` and `Action configuration/Execute` permissions have access to AI-driven tools.
For example, they can [enhance or improve the text](create_edit_content_items.md#ai-assistant) that they have written, or [generate alternative text](upload_images.md#ai) for images.

If you have the right permissions, you can decide what capabilities are available to the editors by enabling AI actions.
You can also modify the parameters of individual AI actions, to control the creativity of the AI or the cost involved with using it.

For more information, see [Work with AI actions](work_with_ai_actions.md#edit-existing-ai-actions).
