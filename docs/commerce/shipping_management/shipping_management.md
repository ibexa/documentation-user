# Shipping management

If the permissions assigned to your [user role](permissions_and_users.md) allow, the Shipping management module enables you to define and manage shipping methods of different types on the **Shipping methods** screen.

The Shipping management module interacts with other packages of the system, so that shipment processing is cancelled automatically when the customer cancels their order.
