# Ibexa Engage

[[= product_name_engage =]] is a data collection tool. It gives you the ability to use the [Qualifio](https://qualifio.com/) tools to engage your audiences.
You can use interactive content to build relationships and collect important data, for example, a list of recent orders, or personal information about customers.

## Campaign

A campaign is a collection of ideas that the user can customize and divide into steps.

It consists of a welcome screen, a form step, an interaction element, and an exit screen.

You can use Qualifio's existing templates and interactive elements, such as quizzes, pools, and forms, to create visually appealing, customized campaigns.
Qualifio configures the backgrounds, themes, and designs.

Use campaign to interact with viewers, boost ad impressions, or gather cookies from targeted audiences.

Each campaign comes with a unique ID - string of numbers, that the platform automatically defines at the creation. Campaign ID is a reference to the campaign in the applications, services and data connections.

You can set up prizes for customer when an email or another required pool is filled.
A prize can be, like special discount, bonus, or free access to some content.
You can set up a specific time frame for each campaign, use conditions, and design.

## Publication channel

Every campaign includes a minimum of one publication channel that you can choose from the three options the platform provides for publishing a campaign:

- **Widget/iframe** - uses a JavaScript code or an HTML iframe from Qualifio. Additionally, you can use oEmbed, Facebook Instant articles, and AMP technologies to publish iframes. You need to manually paste the code into your website or CMS.

- **Minisite** - uses a unique URL from Qualifio that can hosts the campaign. This URL points to your subdomain.

- **Mobile** - uses a link from Qialifio to integrate a campaign that is optimized for mobile usage.

Each publication channel type is automatically responsive and can be use on any mobile device.
