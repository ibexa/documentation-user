# Upload and store images

!!! note

    Some options may not be available depending on your configuration and permissions.

## Manage folders

By default, uploaded files are stored in the Media root folder.
If you want to upload them to different location, navigate to the folder you want to upload to.

### Add folders

1\. Go to **Content** -> **Media**.

2\. In the upper-right corner click **Create content**.

3\. From the available content types, select **Folder**, and click **Create**.

4\. Enter name for the new folder.

5\. (Optional) Add folder description.

6\. Click **Publish**.

The newly created folder is now visible in the content tree structure.
You can create subfolders by clicking the folder and repeating the above procedure.

## Add image

1\. Go to **Content** -> **Media**.

2\. In the upper-right corner click **Create content**.

3\. From the available content types, select **Image** and click **Create**.

4\. Provide image title.

5\. In the **Asset** section, click **Upload file** and from the system browser, select an image.

6\. To find images using tags, in the **Tags** field, enter keywords.

Tagging image assets helps keep the media library organized and enables searching images by tags in the DAM.

7\. Click **Publish**.

!!! note

    The maximum file size and file extension limitations may differ depending on your configuration.

## Edit images

After you upload the image, you can adjust it according to your needs. Use built-in Image Editor.
For detailed instructions how to edit images, see the [Image Editor documentation](../image_management/edit_images.md).

## Move images

To learn how to effectively manage image assets, see [Move assets between folders](../content_management/content_organization/copy_move_hide_content.md) section.

## Multiupload

To upload many image assets, you can use multiupload.

1\. In the Media section, go to the folder you want to upload to.

2\. Go to the **Sub-items** tab and click **Upload**.

3\. In the pop-up window, click **Upload** and from the system browser, select an image or drag and drop files.


## Add translations

If you work with multiple languages and want to use searching by languages in DAM, you can add translations to image assets.
