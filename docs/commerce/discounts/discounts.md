# Discounts

Discount is a set of capabilities that enhance the efficiency and creativity of content editors.
The feature is not included in [[= product_name =]] by default.
It's an [LTS Update]([[= developer_doc =]]/ibexa_products/editions#lts-updates) that requires separate [installation]([[= developer_doc =]]/discounts/install_discounts/).

Once Discounts are installed, store managers with the right permissions have the ability to manage discounts and shape the pricing policy of their stores.

For example, they can create time-limited offers on selected products, or reward their newsletter subscribers with special discount codes.

With the Discounts feature, you can create time-limited offers that apply only to specified regions, currencies, products, customers, and more.

For more information, see [Work with Discounts](work_with_discounts.md).
